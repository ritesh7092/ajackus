# My Learning Journey: Building a Library Management System

## Challenges I Faced

1. **Data Validation**
   - Implementing proper validation was more complex
   - Ensuring book IDs are unique and titles/authors aren't empty required careful coding
   - Learning to handle different validation scenarios was a learning curve

2. **Choosing the Right Technology**
   - Deciding between different approaches (CLI vs. REST API)
   - Understanding how Spring Boot works

3. **Error Handling**
   - Handling different types of exceptions
   - Making sure the application doesn't crash on invalid inputs

## What I Learned

1. **Coding Best Practices**
   - The importance of writing clean, modular code
   - How to structure a Spring Boot project
   - The value of separating concerns (model, service, controller)

2. **Problem-Solving Skills**
   - Breaking down complex requirements into smaller, manageable tasks
   - Thinking through different use cases and potential errors

## Improvements I Would Make with More Time

1. **Enhanced Features**
   - Add user authentication and authorization
   - Add more detailed reporting features

2. **Better User Experience**
   - Create a friendly web interface
   - Add more detailed error messages
   - Implement more comprehensive logging
   - Create a more intuitive search function

3. **Advanced Validations**
   - More robust input validation
   - Add more detailed checks for book details
   - Implement more complex business rules


4. **Testing**
   - Write more comprehensive unit and integration tests
   - Add end-to-end testing scenarios
   - Create mock data for thorough testing
